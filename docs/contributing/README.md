## Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone
```bash
# Fork on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/oxide.git
cd oxide
git remote add upstream https://github.com/oat-im/oxide.git
```

### 2. Create a Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

### 3. Make Your Changes
- Follow the [C++ Manual](../development/cpp-manual.md)
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Keep commits focused and atomic

### 4. Test Your Changes
```bash
# Build and run tests
cmake --preset debug -DOXIDE_BUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build --preset debug
ctest --preset debug
```

### 5. Submit a Pull Request
- Push to your fork
- Open a PR against `main`
- Fill out the PR template completely
- Wait for CI to pass

## Contribution Standards

### Code Quality
- **Follow the [C++ Manual](../development/cpp-manual.md)** - No exceptions
- **Write tests** - New features need tests
- **Document APIs** - Public headers need documentation
- **No compiler warnings** - Code must build clean

### Commit Messages
Follow conventional commits:
```
type(scope): brief description

Longer explanation if needed. Wrap at 72 characters.

Fixes #123
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `perf`

### Pull Request Guidelines
- **One feature per PR** - Keep PRs focused
- **Link related issues** - Use "Fixes #123" in description
- **Update CHANGELOG** - Add entry for user-visible changes
- **Pass all CI checks** - No failing tests or builds

### AI-Generated Content
See our [AI Policy](ai-policy.md) for rules on AI-generated contributions.

## Review Process

### What to Expect
1. **Automated Checks** - CI runs immediately
2. **Initial Review** - Maintainer reviews within 2-3 days
3. **Feedback Round** - Address review comments
4. **Final Approval** - Two maintainer approvals required
5. **Merge** - Maintainer merges when ready

### Review Criteria
- **Correctness** - Does it work as intended?
- **Design** - Does it follow project architecture?
- **Standards** - Does it follow our coding standards?
- **Tests** - Are changes adequately tested?
- **Documentation** - Are changes documented?

## Development Environment

- **OS**: Linux (primary), Windows, macOS

### Helpful Commands
```bash
# Format code
clang-format -i src/**/*.cpp include/**/*.h

# Run linter
clang-tidy src/**/*.cpp

# Build specific target
cmake --build --preset debug --target oxide_core

# Run specific test
./build/debug/tests/core_tests --gtest_filter=ErrorTest.*
```
