## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I use Ion Vortex in my commercial game?
A: This is legally complex. AGPL has no linking exception, so any software that links against Ion Vortex libraries may be considered a derivative work that must also be AGPL. Consult legal counsel before using Ion Vortex commercially.

### Q: Do I need to open-source my entire game if I use Ion Vortex?
A: **Probably yes.** AGPL is designed to prevent proprietary use. Unlike LGPL, it has no linking exception. Most legal interpretations suggest that linking against AGPL libraries makes your entire application subject to AGPL. This is why AGPL is rarely used for libraries intended for proprietary software.

### Q: Why use AGPL instead of LGPL or MIT?
A: AGPL ensures that:
- No one can create a closed-source fork of Ion Vortex
- Any improvements to the engine must be shared back
- Commercial competitors cannot use our work without contributing back

If you want to use Ion Vortex in proprietary software, you'll need a commercial license.

### Q: Can I use the public assets in my commercial project?
A: Yes, public assets are CC0 (public domain) and free for any use, regardless of how you use Ion Vortex itself.

### Q: What if I want to keep my modifications or game private?
A: You have two options:
1. **Commercial License**: Contact us at dev@oat.im for proprietary licensing
2. **Don't use Ion Vortex**: If you need a permissively licensed engine, Ion Vortex isn't for you

### Q: Can I run a game server using Ion Vortex without releasing my game's source?
A: No. AGPL's "network use is distribution" clause means running a server counts as distribution. You must provide source code access to all users.

### Q: What about dynamic linking?
A: AGPL makes no distinction between static and dynamic linking. Both are likely to create derivative works that must be AGPL.

### Q: Can I contribute if my employer owns my code?
A: Yes, use the "Employer-Sponsored Contributor" section of the CLA.

### Q: What about AI-generated code?
A: See [Contributing Guidelines](../contributing/ai-policy.md) for our AI policy.

## Disclaimer

This README provides a summary for convenience but is not legal advice. The interpretation of AGPL's linking and derivative work provisions is complex and contentious. **Always consult with legal counsel** before using AGPL software in any commercial or proprietary context.

The AGPL-3.0 license text is authoritative and supersedes any summaries or interpretations in this document.

**The AGPL was specifically chosen to prevent proprietary/commercial use without a separate commercial license agreement.**
