# API Reference Overview

This directory contains the auto-generated C++ API reference for each Oxide library. When built, you’ll find:

- A section for each library under `docs/api/<library>/`
- Detailed class, function, enum, and struct documentation
- Cross-linked pages for types shared between modules

## Libraries Covered

- **core** – Error handling, logging, allocators, timing
- **asset** – glTF loader, meshoptimizer, IBL cache
- **audio** – 3D sound via miniaudio
- **crypto** – Encryption, hashing, signing
- **physics** – Hull generation & broad-phase queries
- **protocol** – Bitpacked network types & framing
- **render** – bgfx init, PBR pipeline
- **ui** – ImGui context & widgets

> _Note_: Individual library pages will be generated by Doxygen (or your chosen doc tool) and placed in subfolders here.
